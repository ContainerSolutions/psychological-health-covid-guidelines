**_By Helen Bartimote,   Lead Psychologist_**

_The following guidance has been written primarily for use by Container Solutions employees globally; but it is being shared externally to act as a useful reminder for all workplaces in these challenging times. It is an ongoing and evolving document and has been compiled using various sources, which have been referenced as much as possible throughout the document._

## **Understanding Anxiety in a Pandemic** 

- Remind yourself that emotions such as sadness, fear, anger and frustration are all perfectly normal reactions to the current situation and you are absolutely not alone in having these feelings.
- Do not try to minimise them or deny they are occurring. Give time to them, although this may feel painful. Accept that you will experience these emotions during this difficult period. It can help to write these feelings down.
- Accept your feelings. It’s a sign that your body’s natural defense mechanisms are activated. You are also more likely to engage in health-seeking behaviours if you accept these feelings.
- Most importantly, focus on what you can control in this situation—i.e., social distancing, choosing to turn off the news, what you eat, your sleep routine, how frequently you check in to social media, etc. _Make a list of what you know you can control and what you feel you cannot_. You are much more likely in this type of extreme event to feel out of control than with other stressors, but if you try to focus on what you can control, this will help. This hopefully will then lead you to spend less time focussing on what is on the ‘out of control’ list.



## **Empathetic Responding**

- In times of crisis and threat, research shows that people will tend to respond in one of three ways; with [some being more helpful than others](https://www.internationalsos.com/client-magazines/looking-after-yourself-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak):
- ‘I wish this would all just stop’ … ‘this will blow over soon’. = **Wishing thinking**, and means you will be less likely to engage in health-related behaviours.
- ‘I need help from _you_ as I cannot cope with this myself’ = **Support seeking**, or excessively relying on others for emotional support. It is important to reach out to others in times of crisis, while at the same time being mindful of the impact this may have on the people around us.
- “I would like to help you’, ‘What can i do to support you’?, ‘I wonder what I can do to help my community with this’?, ‘I wonder how this situation is making X feel’? “How could I help’? = **Empathetic Responding**, which is generally considered to be the most effective for communities and also _for an individual’s own psychological well being_.  Communicate in safe ways with people in your communities who are vulnerable and be a sympathetic ear for those suffering the most. Maintain your relationships.



## **Daily Life**

- Reach out to family and friends as well as colleagues. Consider talking over Slack/text and email as much as possible. Try to create new routines to allow for this time. Remember some of us are experiencing long periods of self-isolation and are uncertain how long this may go on for.
- Refrain from using terms such as ‘the Chinese virus’. This is a global virus, it is not attached to any continent or country. Think about the impact of such labels on people in the community. If someone you know has had the virus, then do not refer to them as ‘victims’ or ‘cases’ but instead ‘people with COVID-19’. This maintains a separation between the person and the illness and allows us to humanise them.
- Take care in the morning. For many people, anxiety can often be worse in the mornings. Just take it a step at a time. Reach out if you would like to have regular hangouts every morning with colleagues
- Be mindful of your media consumption, and how this could also be affecting other people who you may be self-isolating with. Consider the sources of the information you are absorbing. Catastrophic thinking does not care about facts and accurate information, so feeding this with ‘doomsday’ type articles and Twitter feeds is unhelpful. Reduce the number of news alerts you are receiving daily on your phone. 
- Maintain healthy daily routines. Keep to a rhythm if you can: good sleep patterns, healthy diet, frequent hydration, create work/home boundaries if possible, consider practicing meditation ([Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) is a helpful meditation app, but there are others) Use one of the exercise apps, which offers daily routines that can be done at home. Try to have time offline each day and turn your phone off, work in 50- minute bursts and get up to move for 10 minutes. 
- Avoid the excessive use of unhealthy coping strategies, such as drugs and alcohol.  
- If you now have your children at home throughout the day, understand that this is a huge change for them also and they will want to be around and close to you. Look at ways to do this whilst also creating boundaries for you to be able to work. Everyone understands that there is now a ‘new normal’, and if you are having a meeting with a child by your side, this is OK. We all need to adapt to the changing aspects of how to work. Older children can adapt more easily to this new situation, but will still need to understand what these boundaries are and how you are now going to interact as a family.
- If you are now spending more time with your partner and have not both worked from home together in this way before, spend time talking about what you both need. If you are sharing a small space together, talk about how to create the boundaries that you both need.
- Share any positive stories you hear about, including about people who have recovered from COVID-19.

## **Dealing with Loss**



It is likely that we are all going to be experiencing some form of grief over the next few months, not necessarily in terms of bereavement but the loss of normality, freedom of movement, social connection, hobbies, and new experiences.

There will be shock and denial at first and this will move on to feelings of anger. We may move on quite quickly to feeling helpless, overwhelmed and wanting to escape this situation; but it is a cycle and we will move to accepting what has happened and develop new plans and options. We will adapt. ‘[Black Swan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory)’ events have happened repeatedly in the past and they will happen again in the future; we will move on, accepting and learning from this crisis.

## **External Support**



Don’t hold back from asking for help. Reach out to others. If you are feeling overwhelmed and unable to cope, then please speak with your manager at CS. We are all in this together and we will do whatever we can to support and help you. You can also speak confidentially with one of the CS psychologists directly, as many of you are doing currently.

If you feel you would prefer to talk to someone outside of CS, then please consider the following online resources with direction on how to get psychological support:
